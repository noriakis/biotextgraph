KEGG mapping plots produced by pathview can be populated with text information ([Luo and Brouwer. 2013](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/14/1830/232698])).

```{r load, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(wcGeneSummary)
library(pathview)
```

Suppose an example for KEGG Orthology obtained from some microbiome-related experiments.
By using [MicrobiomeProfiler](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/MicrobiomeProfiler), enriched pathway using over-representation analysis can be obtained as follows.

```{r micro, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
kos <- c("K00640","K23304","K01760","K01697","K00549","K00899")
enriched <- MicrobiomeProfiler::enrichKO(kos)
clusterProfiler::cnetplot(enriched)
```
